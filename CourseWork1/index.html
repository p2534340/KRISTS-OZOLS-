  <p>The film starts with action straight away. A bounty of 14 million has been
     put on John Wick's head for killing a member of the international
      assassin's guild. The "High Table" sends brutal assassins to eliminate
      John Wick and strips him from any services that could help him. John Wick
       gets chased throughout the whole of New York as the ruthless assassins
       try to claim the bounty. The film contains epic fighting scenes and
        non-stop action throughout the entire film, exactly what you would
         expect from a John Wick film.
