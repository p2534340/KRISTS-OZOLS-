       The second audio file here should actually be an version of the audio
       file in ogg format. Both of these are mp3 files.
    
       You should also include a fallback for older browsers. That is, some paragraph text after both <source> elements
       that will be displayed if the browser does not support the <audio> element. Typically, this might include a link
       to download the mp3 version.

  <p>There are only a handful of places that I've traveled to. I come from
  Latvia, Now I live in England(Unted Kingdom), I've traveled to Netherlands,
Poland, and Spain. I would love to travel the whole of europe, and after I
would like to start exploring Asia. I would love to live in different places
for couple of years. I would start with California, Los Angeles (USA),
after I would like to live back in my home country which is Latvia. Finally
when I retire, I would Love to live in Barcelona(Spain). </p>

     You've got the poster attribute here, but you need to provide a value to tell the 
     browser where the image is that you'd like to use for a poster. For example:

     <video width="100%" autoplay poster="img/videoPoster.jpg">

     As with the <audio> element, you also need to provide a fallback for browsers
     that don't support the <video> element.
     *** -->
<video width="100%" autoplay poster controls>
  <source src="video/map.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="video/map.webm" type="video/webm">

  </video>
