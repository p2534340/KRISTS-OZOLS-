  <h2> Where I'm from?</h2>
  <p> I Was born in Latvia, Cesis. I grew up in the city of Cesis, later I had
    Moved to a town called "Barkava", where I had lived with my Grandmother.
  Three years passed then I moved to United Kingdom, I settled in a small town

       <h2> What I do with my time?</h2>
       <p> I like to keep myself busy, therefore at the start of the day I plan
         my full day with various activities. Im a very active person, I like
         to go gym and for walks. I wake up with alot of energy, and once I had
         my coffee my day is ready to start. My day can consist of various
         activities such as, make music, study, work out, or play some games
         (Typical teenager lol).</p>

       <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

         <ul>
           <li><strong>Music</strong></li>
           <ul>
             <li> Music is a big part of my life, I mainly listen to old school
             rap/Hip-Hop, but my music taste varies to anything that catches
           my ear.</li>
             <li> I make music myself, I've been making music for nearly a year
             now, hopefully one day people will recognise my work. </li>
           </ul>
           <li><strong>Sports</strong></li>
           <ul>
             <li>I love working out, going gyms, and playing sports such as
             football or basketball. I really like being active because I
           have so much energy.</li>
             <li>I also like watching sports, but the only sport that I watch
             is UFC. </li>
           </ul>
           <li><strong>Video Games</strong></li>
           <ul>
             <li>When I was younger all I wanted to do is play games, but I
             didn't own a console, therefore I was watching gameplay's on
           Youtube. My Mum bought me a PlayStation for christmas, it was
         like a dream come true, because I got to play games that I was watching
       on youtube.</li>
             <li>I tend to play alot of FPS games because they're the only games
          I'm really good at, I like other games too, but I love action and
          explosions(call me Michael Bay lol). </li>
             </ul>
